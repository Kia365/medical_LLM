        "question": "How do you interpret a chest X-ray for pneumonia?",
        "answer": "When interpreting a chest X-ray for pneumonia, look for: 1) Areas of increased opacity or white patches (consolidation), 2) Air bronchograms, 3) Silhouette signs, 4) Pleural effusion.

        "question": "What are the key differences between MRI and CT scans?",
        "answer": "MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of soft tissues, while CT scans use X-rays to create cross-sectional images. MRI is better for soft tissue imaging and doesn't use radiation, but takes longer and is more expensive. CT scans are faster, better for bone imaging, but expose patients to radiation."
